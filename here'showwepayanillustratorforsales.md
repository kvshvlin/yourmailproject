**Here's how we pay an illustrator for sales**.

We offer a case-by-case price starting from Rs. 300 per handmade illustrated postcard,  
**= Your Mail Project's Price (YP)**.

We pay an illustrator his/her Illustrator's Price (IP),  
**= Illustrator's Earnings (IE)**.

We pay Your Mail Project the rest of Your Mail Project's Price (YP),  
= Rs. (YP - IP).

Your Mail Project bears the value of the Cost Price (CP),  
= Rs. [(YP - IP) - CP]  
**= Your Mail Project's Earnings (YE)**.

**Example**.

If Your Mail Project's Price (YP) = Rs. 110.85; Illustrator's Price (IP) = Rs. 100;  

Illustrator's Earnings (IE),  
= Rs. (IP)  
= Rs. 100.00.

Your Mail Project's Earnings (YE),
= Rs. [(YP - IP) - CP]  
= Rs. [(110.85 - 100.00) - 09.85]  
= Rs. [10.85 - 09.85]
= Rs. 01.00.
