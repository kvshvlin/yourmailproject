**Here's how we pay an illustrator for subscriptions**.

We offer a monthly subscription basis starting from Rs. 300 per handmade illustrated postcard,  
**= Subscription Price (SP)**.

We pay an illustrator the first half of the Subscription Price (SP),  
= Rs. (SP / 2)  
= Rs. (300.00 / 2)  
= Rs. 150.00.  
**= Illustrator's Earnings (IE)**.

We pay Your Mail Project the second half of the Subscription Price (SP),  
= Rs. (SP / 2)  
= Rs. (300.00 / 2)  
= Rs. 150.00.

Your Mail Project bears the value of the Cost Price (CP),  
= Rs. (150.00 - CP)  
= Rs. (150.00 - 09.85)  
= Rs. 140.15.
