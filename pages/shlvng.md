**SHLVNG**.

A wooden shelving designed to be highly customisable to suit your “changing” storage needs.  
Designed by Kushal Samant (Copyrights under The Architect’s Act, 1972).

**Can we design storage systems to accommodate endless shopping sprees**?

**Ethos**.  
**Essentialism**.

It is a practice that pursues one specific idea.

For us, this idea is to create products that meet the needs of our present generations, and do not compromise on the ability of our posterity to meet their own needs.

Products that are long-term in their outlook, that do not strive for built-in obsolescence, that prefer to be discreet, adaptable, and faithful servants in the face of a turbulent world.

Products that would be the blank canvas on which to paint your colourful life.

**System thinking**.

Our products are systems designed with high-quality specification and natural finishes to ensure evolution, flexibility, adaptability, durability and therefore, longevity.

They are comprised of components assembled with interlocking joints (ie, not bonded or welded), simple to construct, to permit repair and end-of-life dismantling.

They are designed to be useful, and built to last as long as possible.

Our customers are able to take their furniture from home to home while adding, subtracting or dividing as necessary.

Our shelving is timeless; it moves with you when you move; and constant additions and improvements ensure that it always caters for today’s needs.

This means that our products cost you less than cheaper alternatives.

You can buy one shelf or an entire library.

**Ten principles for good design**.

Dieter Rams famously said, “I imagine our current situation will cause future generations to shudder at the thoughtlessness in the way in which we today fill our homes, our cities and our landscape with a chaos of assorted junk.”

Back in the late 1970s, Dieter Rams was becoming increasingly concerned by the state of the world around him: “An impenetrable confusion of forms, colours and noises.”

Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself an important question: Is my design good design?

His answer is expressed in his ten principles for good design.

**How the system works!**  
![__](https://66.media.tumblr.com/df55a2f96ecf1d1e000a4815104e8630/0a2f6f3142b7cf22-8e/s540x810/ffbf8dd68d0364c64d5df3c893310bf426c82a1c.jpg)

At the core of the shelving system is a wooden component with slits.

The shelves, and cabinets are all formed by simply sliding other components into place.

No tools are needed.

The easy interchangeability of the components encourages either day-to-day re-arrangements or complete re-configurations.

_9 inch (228 mm) of flexibility_. - The components can be interlocked in slits at a distance of 9 inch (228 mm) from each other.

The combinations of these interlocking widths will conform to almost any available space.

_Natural Birch Wood (18mm, All Weather Proof, and Treated)_. - We provide components made from natural birch wood.

Most wall mounted structures require a smooth wall with 90 degree of flatness, which are often unavailable.

The interlocking components are self supporting.

This means that they can be plonked in any available space for a simple and low-cost form of the system.

When combined with the easy adjustment of the vertical spacing between shelves, the system can accommodate almost all storage and display demands.

We suggest taking a moment to measure a few of the items that will go on your shelves.

It is time well spent.

This will help you plan your ideal system.

**How easy is it to install?**

You can slide all the components into place.

Much easier than you might think.

We test every order you place to ensure this ease of assembly before we ship it for delivery.

Most importantly, you can add extra components at any time in the future, safe in the knowledge that they will be both available and compatible.

Reassuring.

Large systems can be accumulated as your collection grows.

There are no limits to the scale of your shelving system.

**Here’s the fine-print in a more readable size**.  
**Product Care**.

Colour, finishes and materials may vary slightly depending upon the materials.

We use only natural birch wood.

The material is fully treated; do not subject to heat or moisture.

Wood might darken naturally when first exposed to sunlight; it is therefore advisable to move items on the surfaces during the early months of use.

Beware that electrical equipment (laptops, DVDs, hifi etc) can become very hot in use. If in doubt, put your laptop on a stand, a mat.

**Liability**.

We reserve the right to not install a system as we deem fit according to site conditions.

For all systems the interlocking joints must always be re-tightened firmly after the initial loading of shelves, and checked periodically thereafter, especially if they are seen to move in the loose position.

They must never be left in the loose position.

We are not able to accept liability for the poor condition of walls, floors or ceilings against which the system is installed.

Accordingly, we reserve the right not to install your system.

If you choose to over-rule our advice, we will be unable to accept any liability for a subsequent failure in your wall/floor/ceiling and/or shelving system.

If we discover unforeseen problems when we are installing your system, we may have to recommend changes to your installation that will cost extra.

The system must not be used as a ladder and neither can you sit or stand on any part of the system.

**Installation**.

We deliver directly from our workshop, assemble your order on site, and take your leave after you sign on our letter of satisfactory completion.

We advise you to be available for these procedures, as they only help us serve you better.

**Cancellation & returns**.

We do not have a return policy, which means we do not accept any returns.

Once you place your order we set an irreversible train on its way: we reserve dispatch dates and start assembling your order precisely for you.

If you are in any doubt, take a little more time thinking.

You can always come back for more later.

**Damages**.

We attend to all damages, case wise.

We advise you to handle our products with care.
