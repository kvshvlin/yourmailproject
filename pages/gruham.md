**Can we make housing free for all**?

**The observation**.  
As a practice, we have been able to serve two kinds of clients.

1. Someone who invests his/her life-savings/gratuity in building a home when he/she is in the age group of 50-60.
1. Someone who commits 15-25 years of his/her life to a housing loan when he/she is in the age group of 25-35.

The issue with the first case is that,  
1. Even after committing a lifetime to work, economies of most countries are unable to support housing to this category of the population.

The issue with the second case is that,  
1. The youth is committing to do jobs that they may not know if they will like for almost two decades of their lives.

1. In most cases, there is a growing resentment that swells from this adulting.
1. In most cases, these people cannot make that career change/ do what makes them happy because of that prior housing loan committment.

**The realization led us to these questions**.

**Can we make housing free for the end user?**  
Since money was the problem, we reasoned that housing should be devoid of money to the end user. We believe that with this, every member of the society will be able to choose to do what he/she truly loves. It will bring fulfillment to their lives. It will help them stay positive, and stress-free. We believe that the process discussed below can act as a catalyst for rebuilding community bonds, and hence foster healthier societies.

**Can the cost of housing be borne by travellers?**  
In search of the answer, GRÜHAM began with ideas similar to selling products/services, and then employing these profits for building social housing projects. The idea of creating a profitable business model to enable large scale social impact led us to a route map for how this could be achieved. It begins here.

**People travel**.  
With the advent of Airbnb it is now easier to host someone as guests at your home. Airbnb safeguards all the parties involved under Airbnb’s terms and conditions.

- In simple words, what we visualize is that:

1. The guests pre-book their stay on an network of homes that is built in time for their arrival.
1. The end users shall honor their commitment as hosts for these pre-bookings.

- The following factors are essential to settle the accounts:

1. End users will own the built structure.
1. End users shall be comfortable with couch-surfing.

1. The funds from pre-booking shall pay the bills, irrespective of the bills raised, including the expenses incurred for logistics and other operations.
1. The end users shall serve as Airbnb /couch-surfing hosts to repay any investors on board.

**Airbnb on trials**.  
In 2015, Kushal Samant & Sachin Maheshwari formed the WikiHouse/BOM chapter of <a href="https://www.wikihouse.cc/Contributors" target="_blank">The WikiHouse Project</a> 
in Bombay. In 2016, <a href="http://www.mao.si" target="_blank">Muzej Za Arhitekturo In Oblikovanje</a> 
published this work for <a href="https://futurearchitectureplatform.org/projects/8e8af477-4aea-431b-a69f-74cd05862eac" target="_blank">Future Architecture Platform</a>. They won an Entrepreneurship Cell Award 2016 in Mumbai. They used the prize money to host on Airbnb in Mumbai to test the hospitality platform as a means of revenue. In February 2017, Sachin Maheshwari parted ways to start his own ventures. The duo was awarded “Airbnb Superhost” status in October 2017. Kushal Samant now commercially builds WikiHouse through GRÜHAM.
