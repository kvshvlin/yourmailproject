**Here's how this works**.

**Step 1**. Press the '<a href="https://yourmailproject.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Join Us</a>' button and fill the form inside so we can use your postal address along with your name, phone number, and pin code to send you 11 blank postcards to illustrate upon.

**Note**: Please bear in mind that only your name will be mentioned publicly at the bottom of this page.

**Step 2**. After you receive these 11 postcards, illustrate 10 postcards anyhow you fancy by hand and use 1 postcard to test your art materials.

**Step 3**. Share work-in-progress images to your Instagram stories and tag our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram account @yourmailproject</a>, or make an Instagram post and use hashtag #yourmailproject.

**Step 4**. Mail your handmade illustrated postcards to us as soon as possible via speed post along with your Illustrator's Price (IP) for each.

**Step 5**. Albeit the original illustrator reserves all copyrights, after we receive an illustrator's submission we use Your Mail Project brand assets to curate the project thenceforth.

**Step 6**. Every handmade illustrated postcard is an exclusive product that will never be replicated in analog format and can be sent to friends and family via India Post with/without an accompanying message.

**Step 7**. Once a sale happens, we pay the illustrator his/her Illustrator's Price (IP).

**Step 8**. Every handmade illustrated postcard is available for sale without the guarantee that it will sell.  
All payouts to illustrators are only valid after their handmade illustrated postcards sell.  
All unsold handmade illustrated postcards will be returned to the original illustrator on demand.

**Step 9**. We do not accept returns orders. We handle complaints, inventory, operations, packaging, shipping, suggestions, and more.
