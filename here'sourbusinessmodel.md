**Here's our business model**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model. We run a business model to create revenue for various illustrators.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
= Rs. (05.50 for the blank postcards + 05.00 for the envelope + 41.50 for speed post)  
= Rs. (05.50 + 05.00 + 41.50)  
= Rs. 52.00.  
**= Cost A (CA)**.

Shipping 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
= Rs. (05.00 for the envelope + 41.50 for speed post)  
= Rs. (05.00 + 41.50)  
= Rs. 46.50.  
**= Cost B (CB)**.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost,  
= Rs. (CA + CB) / 10 blank postcards in the package  
= Rs. [(52.00 + 46.50) / 10]  
= Rs. [98.50 / 10]  
= Rs. 09.85.  
**= Cost Price (CP)**.

Illustrators have to use their own materials to create the illustrations. We cannot be sure of certain values (including but not limited to) the cost of labour, cost of materials, expected profit, PLUS any particulars deemed necessary. Hence, we request all illustrators to calculate their selling price for every blank postcard they illustrate. They should send a note alongwith their handmade illustrated postcards to inform us about their **Illustrator's Price (IP)**.

Once a sale happens, we pay an illustrator on a first priority basis.
