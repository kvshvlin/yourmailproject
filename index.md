Your Mail Project keeps things simple, thoughtful, and transparent.

**Here's how this works**.

**Step 1**. If you fill <a class="typeform-share link" href="https://form.typeform.com/to/krhWpQJZ?typeform-medium=embed-snippet" data-mode="drawer_right" style="color:#D54321;text-decoration:underline;font-size:15px;" target="_blank">this</a> <script> (function() { var qs,js,q,s,d=document, gi=d.getElementById, ce=d.createElement, gt=d.getElementsByTagName, id="typef_orm_share", b="https://embed.typeform.com/"; if(!gi.call(d,id)){ js=ce.call(d,"script"); js.id=id; js.src=b+"embed.js"; q=gt.call(d,"script")[0]; q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q) } })() </script> form, we will use your postal address alongwith your name, phone number, and pincode to send you 11 blank postcards to illustrate upon.

**Note**: Please bear in mind that only your name will be mentioned publicly at the bottom of this page.

**Step 2**. After you receive these 11 postcards, illustrate 10 postcards anyhow you fancy and use 1 postcard to test your art materials.

**Step 3**. Share work-in-progress images to your Instagram stories and tag our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instagram account @yourmailproject</a>, or make an Instagram post and use hashtag #yourmailproject.

**Step 4**. Mail your illustrated postcards to us as soon as possible via speed post along with your preferred selling price for each.

**Step 5**. Albeit the original author reserves all copyrights, after we receive an illustrator's submission we use Your Mail Project brand assets to curate the project thenceforth.

**Step 6**. Every customer gets an exclusive product that will never be replicated in analog format and can be sent to friends and family via India Post with/without an accompanying message.

**Step 7**. Once a sale happens, we pay the illustrator.

**Step 8**. Every handmade illustrated postcard is available for sale without the guarantee that it will sell, so all payouts to illustrators are only valid for sold goods, and only unsold goods can be returned to the original author on demand.

**Step 9**. You can buy handmade illustrated postcards online on <a href="https://gumroad.com/yourmailproject" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gumroad</a>.

**Step 10**. We handle complaints, inventory, operations, packaging, return orders, shipping, suggestions, and more.

**Here's our business model**.

We are sharing the following information to demystify our business model.

The package of 11 blank postcards costs,  
Rs. 05.50 for the blank postcards +  
Rs. 05.00 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.50 for speed post  
= Rs. 52.00.  
**= Cost A (CA)**.

Illustrators have to use their own materials to create the illustrations. We cannot be sure of certain values (including but not limited to) the cost of labour, cost of materials, expected profit, PLUS any particulars deemed necessary.

Shipping 10 handmade illustrated postcards to our address should approximately cost,  
Rs. 05.00 for the envelope +  
Rs. 41.50 for speed post  
= Rs. 46.50.  
**= Cost B (CB)**.

Making 1 handmade illustrated postcard shop-ready should approximately cost,  
(CA + CB) / 10 postcards in the package  
= (Rs. 52.00 + Rs. 46.50) / 10  
= Rs. 98.50 / 10  
= Rs. 09.85.  
**= Cost Price (CP)**.

We request all illustrators to calculate their preferred selling price for every postcard they illustrate. They should send a note alongwith their handmade illustrated postcards to inform us about their **Preferred Selling Price (PSP)**.

We sell a postcard in the market for the **Billing Price (X)**.

**Note**: Please bear in mind that the value of X is determined on a case-by-case basis.

Once a sale happens, we pay an illustrator on a first priority basis.

**Here's how we pay an illustrator**.

**Case 1**.  
Equation: If X < PSP, Illustrator's earnings = X; Your Mail Project's earnings = Rs. 00.00.

If X is lesser than PSP,  
then we pay the illustrator the value of X.  
Please note that we make Rs. 00.00 profit here.

Example, If X = Rs. 100.00; PSP = Rs. 101;  
then X < PSP;  
Illustrator's earnings = Rs. 100.00;  
Your Mail Project's earnings = Rs. 00.00.

**Case 2**.  
Equation: If X > PSP, Illustrator's earnings = PSP; Your Mail Project's earnings = (X - PSP).

If X is greater than PSP,  
then we pay the illustrator the value of PSP.  
Please note that we make Rs. (X - PSP) profit here.

Example, If X = Rs. 101.00; PSP = Rs. 100;  
then X > PSP;  
Illustrator's earnings = Rs. 100.00;  
Your Mail Project's earnings = Rs. 01.00.

**Case 3**.  
Equation: If PSP = N/A, Illustrator's earnings = (X / 2); Your Mail Project's earnings = ([X / 2] - CP).

If in any case the value of PSP is not informed to us,  
then we pay the illustrator the value of (X / 2).  
Please note that we make Rs. ([X / 2] - CP) profit here.

Example, If X = Rs. 100.00; PSP = N/A;  
then Illustrator's earnings = Rs. (100.00 / 2) = Rs. 50;  
Your Mail Project's earnings = Rs. ([100.00 / 2] - Rs. 09.85) = Rs. 40.15.
